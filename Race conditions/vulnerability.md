****Race condition**** occurs when multiple threads or processes read and write the same variable i.e. they have access to some shared data and they try to change it at the same time. In such a scenario threads are “racing” each other to access/change the data.

## **TOCTOU**
Race conditions on OS level often show up in what is called a ==TOCTOU== situation.
**TOCTOU** = Time Of Check To Time Of Use
Meaning:
1. The OS checks something (like file permissions)
2. A tiny time gap happens
3. The OS then uses that thing (reads/writes/executes)
4. During that tiny gap, an attacker changes the object

So the system thinks:  
“Yeah everything is safe, go ahead.”

But actually, _it’s not_, because the attacker swapped or modified the resource mid-operation.

The most popular OS-level race attack:  
## **Symlink Race Attack**
Example:  
Say a program (running as root) does:
1. Check if `/tmp/user_data` is safe to write → seems safe.
2. Then it writes to it.

Attacker races in and does:
```
ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/user_data
```

## **PID Reuse / File Descriptor Reuse**  
OS reuses IDs when processes quit. If a program assumes “this ID belongs to X,” that assumption can be abused by timing-based interference.
