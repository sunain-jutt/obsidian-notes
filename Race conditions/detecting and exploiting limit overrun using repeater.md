their is a shopping website and a free coupon code that applies only once. but their is a delay while applying the coupon code to the product.
write the coupon code and hit the apply button, their will be a **POST /cart/coupon** request.
send this request to repeater, click **custom action** from the left side panel. 

new -> from template -> trigger race condition

their will be a loop in that section, set the loop you want and test the feature.
refresh the browser and you will see that coupon is applied so much time.
